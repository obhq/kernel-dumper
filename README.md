# Kernel Dumper
[![CI](https://github.com/obhq/kernel-dumper/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/obhq/kernel-dumper/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Kernel Dumper is a payload for PS4 kernel to dump the kernel. Only 11.00 is supported.

## Setup

Plug a USB drive to the PS4 and make sure the PS4 can write some files to it. You can test this by copy some game screenshots to it to see if it success without any errors.

## Running

You need to use TheFloW [PPPwn](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn) with `--stage2` pointed to `kernel-dumper.bin` like the following:

```sh
sudo python3 pppwn.py --interface=enp0s3 --fw=1100 --stage2=kernel-dumper.bin
```

Wait for a notification `Dump completed!`. This may take a couple of minutes depend on how fast is your USB drive. Then shutdown the PS4 (not putting it into rest mode). Once the PS4 completely shutdown unplug the USB drive to grab `kernel.elf`.

To load this dump in Ghidra you need to load as a `Raw Binary` with a correct `Base Address` and `x86:default:64:little:gcc` as a `Language`. Use `readelf` to find a value for `Base Address`:

```sh
readelf -l kernel.elf
```

It will output something like:

```
Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0xffffffff9b68c8b0
There are 6 program headers, starting at offset 64

```

The value for `Base Address` is `VirtAddr` of the first `LOAD` program (e.g. `0xffffffff9b480000` for the above dump). Each dump will have a different address due to ASLR so you can't use the above information with your dump.
